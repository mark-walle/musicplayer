PLANNING
I envision these objects:
Library(contains Artists)
Artist (contains Albums)
Album (contains Songs)
Playlist (contains Artist)
Player (interfaces with Library and mp3 program)

User interaction will occur through the Player object which will interact with Library/Playlist
A database connection will be required
Playlist can export to m3u

Stage 1:
enable playing of a single file

Stage 2:
enable list of files to play

Stage 3:
enable library of files

Stage 4:
play files through Playlist objects
